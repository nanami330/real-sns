Getting Started with Create React App
This project was initialized using Create React App.

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### ``` npm start ```
Starts the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view it.

The page will automatically reload when you make changes.
You may also see linting errors in the console.

### ``` npm test ```
Starts the test runner in interactive watch mode.
Refer to the "Running Tests" section for more details.

### ``` npm run build ```
Builds the app for production and outputs the result to the build folder.
It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance.

The output is minified, and filenames include content hashes.
Your app is now ready to be deployed!

See the "Deployment" section for more information.

### ``` npm run eject ```
Warning: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you cannot undo it!

If you're not satisfied with the default build setup and configurations, you can eject at any time.
This command will copy all configuration files and dependencies (like Webpack, Babel, and ESLint) into your project so you have full control over them.

All commands except eject will still work, but they'll use the newly copied scripts, which you can now customize as needed.

Keep in mind, you never have to use eject.
The default configuration is well-suited for small to medium-sized projects. However, the option is available if you ever need deeper customization.
